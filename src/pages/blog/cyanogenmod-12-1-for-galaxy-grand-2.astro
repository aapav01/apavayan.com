    Galaxy Grand 2 device was released by Samsung a year and half ago. The company promised to give the 4.4 update to the Galaxy Grand 2 which had 4.3 (Jellybean) when shipped. But developers haven't stopped pushing the limits of what's possible on the Grand 2. They've ported CyanogenMod for the Galaxy Grand 2, bringing Android 5.1 Lollipop to this device!

  <p>
    The Galaxy Grand 2 specs easily support Lollipop, featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 CPU with 1.5GB of RAM and a decent 8MP rear camera with 2MP front camera. The device also supports Dual SIM functionality.

    Recently, Galaxy Grand 2 got an unofficial update by an XDA developer which brought the Dual SIM fix. This made the unofficial port completely stable for everyday use. There are no major bugs reported on this version.
