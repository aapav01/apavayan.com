    <strong>Tune in Wednesday, March 19 to watch Jim Wicks talk about the design of the new wearable</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Motorola just dropped the bombshell of Moto 360 on us moments ago, and now we'll have a better idea of how it was designed tomorrow with a Hangout on Air hosted by lead designer Jim Wicks. The Hangout is scheduled for Wednesday, March 19th, where Wicks will dive deep into the design philosophy behind this revolutionary smartwatch.
  </p>

  <h2>About the Moto 360</h2>

  <p>
    The Moto 360 represents a paradigm shift in wearable design. Unlike the rectangular smartwatches that have dominated the market, Motorola has chosen a classic round watch face that looks stunning and feels natural on the wrist.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Design Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Circular display - a first for smartwatches</li>
    <li>Premium materials: stainless steel and genuine leather</li>
    <li>Classic watch aesthetics with modern technology</li>
    <li>Powered by Android Wear</li>
    <li>Google Now integration</li>
    <li>"OK Google" voice commands</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to Expect from the Hangout</h2>

  <p>
    Jim Wicks, Motorola's Senior VP of Consumer Experience Design, will discuss:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The inspiration behind the circular design</li>
    <li>Material choices and craftsmanship</li>
    <li>How they balanced fashion with technology</li>
    <li>The challenges of building a round smartwatch</li>
    <li>User experience considerations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

  <p>
    The Moto 360 marks a significant moment in wearable technology. While other manufacturers have focused purely on specs and features, Motorola has prioritized design and wearability. This approach could define the future of smartwatches.
  </p>

  <p>
    As someone who has always believed that technology should blend seamlessly into our lives, I'm excited to see Motorola taking this design-first approach. A smartwatch should look like a watch first, and be smart second.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Watch</h2>

  <p>
    The Hangout will be streamed live on Google+ and YouTube. Make sure to tune in if you're interested in learning about the thought process behind what could be the best-looking smartwatch ever made.
