    Galaxy J7 device was released by Samsung in 2015. The company promised to give the 6.0.1 update to the Galaxy J7 which had 5.1 (Lollipop) when shipped. But developers haven't stopped pushing the boundaries - they've ported LineageOS for the Galaxy J7, bringing Android 7.1 Nougat to this popular mid-range device!
  </p>

  <p>
    The Galaxy J7 specs easily support Nougat, featuring an Exynos 7580 CPU with 1.5GB of RAM and a solid 13MP rear camera with 5MP front camera. The device's hardware is more than capable of running the latest custom ROMs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently, Galaxy J7 got an unofficial update by an XDA developer which brought Dual SIM support, Camera fixes, and even resolved the random reboot issues. The unofficial port is now nearly stable with most bugs being addressed. The remaining minor issues are expected to be fixed soon.
